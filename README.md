How to do project deploy with Nginx.

## Requirements
Im using only Nginx 1.14.0. In distros from Debian it can be installed with:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
```
If you have some problem installing Nginx you can visit the [oficial page](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/).

## Other requirements
To host a project you obviously need some project. For trainning you can use the `html_test` project in this repository. It was just a random sample with html + css + js.
To get it you can just download this repo or clone it with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LeonardoZanotti/nginx-deploy.git
```
